## Overview

ARA AI is a comprehensive stock prediction system powered by an ensemble of 8 machine learning models, delivering high-accuracy predictions with realistic bounds and comprehensive financial analysis.

### Key Features

- **8-Model Ensemble**: XGBoost (99.7%), LightGBM, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, Ridge, Elastic Net, Lasso
- **98.5% Accuracy**: Ensemble model with validated performance metrics
- **Realistic Predictions**: Proper bounds (±5% daily, ±15% total) prevent unrealistic forecasts
- **Financial Health Analysis**: A+ to F grades based on debt, liquidity, profitability metrics
- **AI Sentiment Analysis**: Hugging Face RoBERTa for market sentiment
- **44 Technical Indicators**: Comprehensive feature engineering
- **Offline Operation**: All models run locally, no API keys required
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows, Linux, macOS support
